# Business Process Automation using Google Sheets and ChatGPT

## Project Description
This project demonstrates how routine business tasks can be automated by integrating Google Sheets with the capabilities of ChatGPT. The project includes a series of implemented tools for conducting CustDev interviews, defining the target audience, generating hypotheses, and creating cold sales scripts.

The project serves as a training example that can be adapted for real business needs.
